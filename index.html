            <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I'm a MERN Stack Developer. I'm learning web development since 2018 when I was a 2nd year varsity going
                student. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4 from Coders Trust Bangladesh(CTB). I got some projects
                on Fiverr marketplace at the time when I was a student of CTB. It was a 6 months duration Responsive Web
                Design course. I have completed my BSc in CSE from Daffodil International University in August 2020 and
                then got a job
                in Frontend Web Development. Currently I'm working as a full time Frontend Web Developer. From September
                2021, again I'm starting Web Development and this time I choose Full Stack Web
                Development. I brought a career track from Bohubrihi Online Course. I have learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                Modern JavaScript, React with Redux, NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJs. Also I have learned React Native for
                multiplatform mobile application development.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm a student of Programming Hero 5th batch. I came here to learn more about MERN stack. My
                ultimate target is practice more and more in a guided environment and this is my first practice project
                using only HTMl, CSS.</p>

            <h3>Go with the flow of Programming Hero</h3>
            <p class="middle-text">At the end of the course I want to see myself where a developer can develop any kind
                of web application.
                Of course I'll not be a pro but what I want is, become a developer with the confidence "YES, I CAN DO
                IT!" event if the project is not known to me!</p>
